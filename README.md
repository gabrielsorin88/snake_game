# snake_game

Using OOP and Turtle Graphics I have built a Snake Game that can keep track of the score, increase the body for every “food” object that the head of the snake collided with,
generate new “food” objects, end the game if the head of the snake has collided with the wall or the body. The Snake can be controlled by using the keyboard arrows.
